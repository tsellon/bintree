A place to keep tree implementations.
  bintree.py contains a sorted binary tree implementation
  rbtree.py contains a red-black tree implementation, which inherits
    from the bintree implementation.

Things which I still need to add:
  * Node deletion
  * Allow overriding of default comparison operator
  * Allow building from data structures other than lists

Motivation behind this:
  Realized that I couldn't remember how red-black trees worked, and
  so decided to write one as a refresher. This isn't intended for a
  production system, but as a learning toy.
